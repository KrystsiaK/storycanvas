# StoryCanvas: Technology Stack & System Architecture

## 1. Guiding Principles for Technology Selection

The technology stack for StoryCanvas is chosen based on the following core principles:

- **Scalability & Performance**: The architecture must handle a rapidly growing user base and the intensive computational demands of AI content generation without compromising on user experience.
- **Developer Velocity**: We will prioritize technologies with strong ecosystems, excellent documentation, and large talent pools to enable rapid development and iteration.
- **Cost-Effectiveness**: The stack must be optimized for cost, particularly in managing the operational expenses of third-party AI services and cloud infrastructure.
- **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: To reach the widest possible audience from day one, the mobile application will be built on a cross-platform framework.
- **Reliability & Maintainability**: We will use proven, stable technologies and managed services wherever possible to reduce operational overhead and ensure high availability.

## 2. High-Level System Architecture

The system is designed as a cloud-native, microservices-oriented architecture. The core components include a cross-platform mobile application, a scalable backend API, an asynchronous job queue for AI processing, and integrations with best-in-class third-party AI services. Media assets are stored in a dedicated object storage service and delivered globally via a Content Delivery Network (CDN) to ensure low-latency access for users worldwide.

## 4. Data Management & Persistence

- **User Data**: All user-related information, including authentication details (hashed passwords), profiles, and subscription status, will be stored in the **PostgreSQL** database.
- **Story Metadata**: Information about each story—such as the title, character descriptions, genre, and pointers to the media assets—will also be stored in **PostgreSQL**.
- **Media Assets**: The actual generated content (images, audio files, video files, PDFs) will be stored in **Amazon S3**. This is more cost-effective and scalable for large binary files.
- **Caching**: **Redis** will be used to cache session data and frequently requested database queries to improve performance.

## 5. Rationale for Key Decisions

- **React Native over Native (Swift/Kotlin)**: While native development offers the best performance, the speed-to-market advantage of a single cross-platform codebase is a significant strategic benefit for an MVP. React Native's maturity makes it a safe and powerful choice.
- **Node.js over Python for Backend**: While Python is strong in AI, Node.js's performance in I/O-bound operations and the ability to use JavaScript across the full stack (frontend and backend) simplifies the development process and reduces context-switching for developers.
- **Microservices over Monolith**: A microservices approach, with a separate job queue for AI tasks, prevents the main API from becoming blocked by long-running generation processes. This is critical for maintaining a responsive user experience.
- **Managed Services over Self-Hosting**: Using managed services like Amazon RDS for PostgreSQL and EKS for Kubernetes significantly reduces the operational complexity and allows the development team to focus on building product features rather than managing infrastructure.
